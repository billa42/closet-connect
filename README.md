Hide text messages in images that can be sent via email and other channels.

## Background
Closet connect emerged from an effort to help LGBTQ+ individuals in countries with widespread discrimination to communicate without being accidentally outed to friends, coworkers, or family. We wanted to find a way for people to connect, while remaining in the closet. Closet connect currently uses fairly simple steganography and is neither sufficient nor intended to be used to hide communication from government authorities or technology-focused corporations.
